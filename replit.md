# CramSmart - Free & Local AI Study Guide Generator

## Overview
CramSmart is a React-based application that transforms your study materials into personalized study guides. It runs a lightweight AI model directly in your browser, so it's completely free, private, and works 100% client-side. No API keys or internet connection are required for processing.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4.19
- **UI Framework**: shadcn-ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: ðŸ¤— Transformers.js (in-browser, local model)
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF, html2canvas

## Recent Changes (Sept 13, 2025)
- âœ… **Architectural Shift**: Migrated from a server-side AI (Google Gemini) to a free, local, in-browser model using `Transformers.js`.
- âœ… **API Key Removal**: Removed all API key-related functionality, making the app 100% free and accessible.
- âœ… **Simplified UI**: Streamlined the user interface by removing customization options in favor of a single "Generate Report" button.
- âœ… **Local AI Processing**: Implemented the `useLocalAi` hook to handle summarization, keyword extraction, and question-answering on the client-side.
- âœ… **Progress Feedback**: Added a progress bar to provide feedback to the user while the local AI models are running.
- âœ… **Code Cleanup**: Removed the obsolete `use-ai.ts` hook and related UI components.
